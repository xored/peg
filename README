The main resources about PEG:

  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

Attention! Every public API besides Block and BlockNode mixins and static slots of Parser class
are the subject to change until version 1.0 is released. If you want your code to be compatible
with future versions, don't use anything besides described above.
